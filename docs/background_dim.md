# Background dim

`InboxRecyclerView` applies soft dimming on the list when its covered by the page. When the content page is pulled and is eligible for collapse, the tint is shifted to the page away to give a visual indication that the page can now be released.

By default, a black tint with a maximum alpha of 15% is applied on the list items. This can be customized by using,

```kotlin
recyclerView.dimPainter = DimPainter.listAndPage(color = Color.WHITE, alpha = 0.65F)
```

If you wish to only apply dimming on the list, `DimPainter.listOnly(...)` can be used.

Itâ€™s also encouraged that apps find other creative ways of communicating this to the user. [Dank](https://saket.me/dank), for example, uses the status bar color to indicate when the content is eligible for collapse.
